## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Upon receiving your report, we will follow these general steps:

1. **Investigation:** Our security team will investigate the reported vulnerability to confirm its existence and severity.

2. **Fixing the Vulnerability:** Once confirmed, our development team will work on fixing the vulnerability. We will strive to provide timely updates on the progress.

3. **Release and Notification:** After fixing the vulnerability, we will release patches or updates as necessary. We will notify users and contributors about the issue and the steps they need to take, if any, to remain secure.

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your dependencies up to date:** Regularly update your dependencies to ensure you are using the latest, most secure versions.

- **Use secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines and best practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into the codebase.
